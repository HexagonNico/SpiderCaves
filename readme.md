Spider Caves is a mod that adds a spider cave biome and a spider armor.

## About

Spider Caves adds an underground spider cave biome that can be recognized by the abundance of cobwebs and spider eggs.
Cobblestone and cobbled deepslate generate in this biome, as well as a larger amount of coal than usual.
You can also find abandoned structures and web covered chests in these caves.
The spider cave biome tends to generate under cold and dry biomes, the kind of environment that spiders like.

Only spiders, cave spiders, and black recluses can spawn in this biome.
The black recluse is a very venomous spider that has a chance to drop a spider fang, needed to craft the spider armor.

The spider armor offers low protection, but wearing the full set gives you a chance to poison your attackers when they
deal direct damage to you.
